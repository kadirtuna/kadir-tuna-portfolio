SOFTWARE DEVELOPER





Possessing a strong foundation in Electrical-Electronics and Computer Engineering, my academic journey began in Electrical-Electronics Engineering, followed by a transition to a double major in Computer Engineering. As an Erasmus student at Rezekne Technologies Academy in Latvia, I expanded my knowledge of Computer Science, working alongside peers from diverse cultural and academic backgrounds. I hold a certificate from the OSYM YOKDIL Exam (76.25/100) and have completed the B1+ Level Preparation at Pamukkale University, demonstrating proficiency in English. With 3 months of professional experience, I focus on Deep Learning (CNNs, LLMs), Algorithm Design, and back-end development, while continuously improving my skills in Low-Level Languages (C, C++). My long-term goal is to advance as a senior back-end developer, specializing in microservices.
